# Red_Beard_CavnasGame
# Overview

This is an HTML canvas game. It is built using only slight html to create the canvas and start/restart button. There is also slight css to formate the html elements, but all other files and code are done in JavaScript.

I wanted to challenge myself with JavaScript, and because I want to go into the game development industry, I decided to attempt to build a canvas game.

# Development Environment

I used Visual studio code, a CSS library from [tailwind](https://cdn.tailwindcss.com), and all assets used in this were not created by me and were found on [Itch.io](itch.io), the creator for the tilset used in the backround was Maaot.

I used JavaScript for most of the development, but with some help on the CSS from [tailwind](https://cdn.tailwindcss.com).

# Future Work

* I want to make it so that way collecting all the coins isn't the end goal, but mab after you do that, a door appears that you can go through to end the game.
